Engine gives a lot of emphasis to building testable applications. Recommended
way to test Engine applications is using `@c11/engine.test` package, which can
be installed like any other npm package.

```sh
npm install -D @c11/engine.test
```

Engine applications are combinations of [views](/docs/api/view) and
[producers](/docs/api/producer). Unit testing Engine applications is achieved by
writing unit tests for its `producer`s and `view`s.
