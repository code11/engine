We have learned almost all the concepts needed to build Engine apps. There is a
bit more to Engine API, about which you can read in the [API
section](/docs/api/engine).

Let's wrap up by finishing our Todos app. Two last UI elements that left putting
life in are:
1. Clearing done Todos
2. Toggling status of all Todos

Both will these actions will follow the principles we have learned so far. A
`view` will accept user's input, and store it in our state, a `producer` will
get triggered and perform the actual task.
