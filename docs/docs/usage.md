## Installation

To build React apps with Engine, we need to install 2 packages:

```sh
   yarn add @c11/engine.macro @c11/engine.react
```

`@c11/engine.macro` is the platform independent core of Engine.
`@c11/engine.react` is needed for building Engine React applications. We can
read more about the Engine packages on [packages](packages) page.

Header over to [React quick start](react-quick-start) page for a peek into what building a react
application with Engine feels like.
