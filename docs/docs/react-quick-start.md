We'll build a React application using Engine to get started. Although Engine
itself is platform neutral, Engine's reactive features really shine in context
of boilerplate laden world of React. So let's get started with:

## Installation

To build React apps with Engine, we need to install 2 packages:

```sh
   yarn add @c11/engine.macro @c11/engine.react
```

`@c11/engine.macro` is the platform independent core of Engine.
`@c11/engine.react` is needed for building Engine React applications. We can
read more about the Engine packages on [packages](packages) page.
