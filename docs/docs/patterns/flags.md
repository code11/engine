Flags store conclusions regarding the state of some data. Usually a producer
will observe some data and then update a single location with flag information.
In this way decisions avoid being computed where they are needed and instead
rely on the state to provide this information.

Keeping flags on the state decreases complexity and helps code to be more
modular.


`user.isAuth` is populated by a producer that uses different sources (local
storage, session, etc) to determine wheter the user has a valid session or not,
and stores this information in the state.

```
{
  user: {
    isAuth: true
  }
}
```

`balloons.items.*.isInflated` is populated by a producer that observes
`ballons.items.*.capacity` and `balloons.items.*.air`. If the air will equal the
capacity it will update the path with `true` otherwise, it'll be `false`.

`balloons.areInflated` is populated by a producer that observes
`balloons.items.*.isInflated` and `balloons.count` and will update the
`areInflated` path once the `isInflated` count is equal to the `balloons.count`


```
{
  balloons: {
    items: {
      "abc": {
        isInflated: false,
        air: 40,
        capacity: 100,
      },
      "xyz": {
        isInflated: true,
        air: 80,
        capacity: 80,
      }
    },
    count: 2,
    areInflated: false,
  }

}
```
