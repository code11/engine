`view` is a babel-macro provided by `@c11/engine.macro` package. It is used for
labeling our React components.

Engine allow us to write boilerplate free applications by writing the
boilerplate itself. Marking a function with `view` type allow us to use other
Engine utilities in the function. Like [Observe](/docs/api/observe) and
[Update](/docs/api/update).
